# OpenBiodiv-2.0

Welcome to the Github page of OpenBiodiv-2.0!
OpenBiodiv is a knowledge graph comprising a Linked Open Dataset from the biodiversity and publishing domains.
Knowledge in OpenBiodiv is extracted from literature published by Pensoft and treatments provided by Plazi. The code behind the development of OpenBiodiv-1.0 is split between the following repositories:  
  - [ROPENBIO]
  - [RDF4R]
  - [OpenBiodiv]

The current repository forks [ROPENBIO] but also contains modified code from the two other repos.
It will contribute to the develoment of the second release of OpenBiodiv.
